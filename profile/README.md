🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
Bugu Sport（不咕约球） is a Wechat Mini Program on the subject of campus sports whose users groups mainly focus on students, including college students, primary and secondary school students. It is now supported on WeChat. The development of the support platforms, including android, ios and web, are being planned.

Bugu Sport (不咕约球微信小程序) is based on the Wechat platform. If you would like to explore this application, please download WeChat and scan the QR code.
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

### 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
